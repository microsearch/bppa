						<td colspan="2" bgcolor="#ffffff"><p align="justify"> On the morning of June 13, 1861, the members of the Boston City Council gathered at the old City   							Hall on School Street for a hearing on the subject of health care. A devastating cholera epidemic had   							left the Massachusetts General Hospital hopelessly overcrowded, and a special committee appointed   							by the City Council had already concluded that a municipal hospital was badly needed. One question   							had yet to be resolved, however. Boston's population was booming, and land was quickly becoming a   							scarce commodity. Where, the residents of the city wanted to know, would this new hospital be located? </p>
                <p align="justify"> The City Council's choices were limited. In fact, the hospital would have to be located in one of two   							areas--either on Fort Hill, in downtown Boston; or in the South End. Several years earlier, a wealthy   							landlord by the name of Elisha Goodnow had become the first patient to undergo surgery at the Massachusetts   							General. Grateful for the care he'd been given, Goodnow had left to the city seven apartment buildings on   							Cross Street in the North End. Under the provisions of Goodnow's will, these buildings would be sold, and   							the proceeds would be used to create a hospital that would cater to the needs of the &quot;less fortunate classes.&quot;   							For some reason, Goodnow had been quite specific about where he wanted this hospital to be located, however.   							The hospital would have to be built either on Fort Hill or in the South End; otherwise, the city wouldn't   							be allowed to inherit Goodnow's property. </p>
                <p align="justify"> At first, the City Council wanted to build the hospital on Fort Hill. But when plans for the new facility were   							announced, a group of wealthy Fort Hill residents, fearful that the hospital would attract &quot;paupers&quot; and other   							unsavory characters, staged a loud and angry protest. The Council quickly reversed its decision, and a site for   							the new hospital was purchased in the South End. </p>
                <p align="justify"> Unfortunately, this plan had one minor flaw: nobody lived in the South End. In 1861, the South End was nothing   							more than a barren landfill, and the nearest home was several miles away. How were patients supposed to get to   							this new facility, a number of citizens asked, when it was located so far away? The Council studied the problem   							carefully, and came up with the following solution: </p>
                <p align="justify"> &quot;This inconvenience will be obviated in some measure by distributing about the city ambulance wagons, contrived   							for the purpose of carrying to the hospital, without jar or exposure, patients unable to endure the motion of   							ordinary vehicles. Upon their arrival they can be raised without exertion by lift to the wards.&quot; </p>
                <p align="justify"> Remarkably, when the Boston City Hospital opened its doors three years  later, the ambulance service still did not exist. In fact, it wasn't  until 1892--twenty-eight years after the hospital was established--that  the City Hospital Ambulance Service transported its first patient.  Originally, the Ambulance Service consisted of eleven horses and two  ambulance carriages. The stables were located on Albany Street, in an  old wooden building that had once served as a smallpox hospital. Twelve  men lived at the facility, and worked as &quot;horsekeepers, chore men, and  porters.&quot; In general, the patients who were transported by the city  ambulances received no medical care until they reached the hospital,  because the men who operated the carriages were given no medical  training. Surgical cases were the exception to this rule. Occasionally,  a surgeon would be dispatched along with the ambulance so that an  injured extremity could be amputated at the scene. Fires were extremely  common during this period, and because the mortality rate for  fire-related injuries was so high, an ambulance was always dispatched  whenever a second alarm was sounded. mortality rate for fire-related  injuries was so high, an ambulance was always dispatched whenever a  second alarm was sounded. </p>
                <p align="justify"> By the turn of the century, a  simple communications system had been installed at the City Hospital's  front gate. Whenever an ambulance bearing an injured patient approached  the hospital, a gatekeeper would phone the Administrator's Office, and  the surgical division of the hospital would be notified that a patient  was about to arrive. Stretchers would be brought to the front door, and  a &quot;surgical house officer would be summoned without delay for immediate  attendance.&quot; </p>
                <p align="justify"> The first ambulance satellite  was established in 1900 at the Boston City Hospital Relief Station in  Haymarket Square. This facility, which was little more than a  three-story, freestanding emergency room had been created in response  to a large number of industrial accidents in the area of North Station.  A large door on the Canal Street side of the building allowed ambulance  carriages to drive directly into the facility. Stables were located on  the ground floor, and sleeping quarters were provided for the ambulance  crews, who essentially lived at the facility. The City Council  considered this arrangement to be a success, and in the coming years, a  number of additional &quot;ambulance stations&quot; were constructed throughout  Boston. </p>
                <p align="justify"> After the turn of the century, horse-drawn ambulances were gradually replaced by mechanized ones. Police department   							ambulances eventually took over much of the city's emergency work, but the City Hospital Ambulance Service would remain   							a fixture in Boston until well into the twentieth century. </p>

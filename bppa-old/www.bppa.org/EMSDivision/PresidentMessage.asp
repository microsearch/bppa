                Lieutenants, Captains and Paramedics who make up the EMS Division 
                of the BPPA, welcome to our web site.</p>
              <p align="left">Since being elected officers of the EMS Division 
                of the BPPA, we have been met with many challenges. Once again, 
                we are faced with a contract that expired in June 2006. We have 
                started the negotiating process and once again will fight for 
                what is best for all members of the alliance. Only by working 
                together will we be able to address the needs of this membership. 
                As we have said before the ultimate &#8220;Bulls eye&#8221; has 
                to be these union offices at 9-11 Shetland Street. This is where 
                progress for the membership is made, not at Boston EMS Headquarters. 
                The benefits that we receive come from the hard working officers 
                of the Executive Board whom you have elected to represent you. 
                There are important issues at stake that need to be addressed, 
                not the least of which is to ensure that the members of this alliance 
                are recognized as the professionals they truly are in serving 
                the citizens and visitors of the City of Boston 24/7.</p>
              <p align="left">EMS today is an ever changing profession. In performing 
                our duties we face certain risks. Unfortunately for our brothers 
                and sisters in other areas of the United States the risks have 
                sadly become a reality. Every year on

					<td colspan="2" bgcolor="#ffffff">Memorial Day weekend members 
                of the union head to Roanoke, VA for the National EMS Memorial 
                Service. This year we honored 26 EMS providers that lost their 
                lives while performing their duties. Unfortunately, this was one 
                of the largest Memorial Services since it first began in 1993. 
                These brave public servants that we honored left their homes and 
                never returned to their families. Let&#8217;s not become complacent, 
                please remain diligent and be safe out there! We must continue 
                to educate people of the dangers we are faced with everyday while 
                reminding the deaf ears at 767 that we are not &#8220;Public Health&#8221;. 
                We are Public Safety!</p>
              <p align="left">Only by working together will we be able to address 
                the needs of the people we serve and the members of the alliance. 
                History has proven results come from the Union not at Boston EMS 
                Headquarters. The benefits that we receive come from the hard 
                working elected officers whom you have chosen to represent you 
                both past and present! Over the past 3 years we have built tremendous 
                relationships on both a state and local level. As Dianne always 
                said: &#8220;A union is a good as its membership makes it!&#8221;</p>

										felt about the passing of our brother George Carter. An employee for 22 years, 
										George endeared himself to his peers and other members of the medical community 
										with his cutting wit, his compassion and complete professionalism. George faced 
										his terminal illness with dignity and humor and, as only George could, went out 
										with &quot;style&quot;. His funeral included a flyover by helicopters, as 
										George was a helicopter pilot. The helicopters flew over the cemetery they 
										missing man formation, as a salute to George. As dedicated as George was to 
										serving the public, especially those in need, he was even more adamant in his 
										role as advisor to the &quot;new guys&quot; in the Department. George was an 
										old-fashioned supervisor, making sure that all bases were covered and that 
										lessons were taught so that mistakes were not repeated. The light of his life 
										was his wife Elizabeth and his praise of her was endless. When George was 
										promoted to Lieutenant he never wavered in his loyalty to all of us in uniform. 
										He won many EMS awards, as recently as May 2000 where he accepted with a joke, 
										as only George could. An award is being established in his name by the Boston 
										EMS Relief Association so that George will continue to live on with us in a 
										positive way. Rest in peace Air Two .<br><br><br> </p>

						<td colspan="2" bgcolor="#ffffff"><p align="justify">It was a very sad day when the Boston EMS family heard of the 
										passing of EMT Jason Dennehey. A native of Charlestown and an employee of BEMS 
										for 7 years, Jason was dedicated to serving the city of Boston. He worked in 
										several districts including downtown Boston, Dorchester and Jamaica Plain. He 
										was known for his meticulous nature. His shirts were always pressed, his boots 
										always shined, and you could rest assured he would ask for at least one Code 17 
										per week to keep the ambulance in tip top shape. He almost always started a 
										shift with a cup of Dunkin Donuts hazelnut coffee and listened keenly to the 
										fire radio waiting to pounce on the nearest fire call. A friendly game existed 
										between the A13 and A5 night crews to see who could offer up first for the west 
										zone fire and actually get assigned to the call. But you always knew that in 
										the rare event that Jason didn't get the assignment, he would still be lurking 
										right around the corner awaiting the call for backup.<br />
										<br />
										Jason had a wonderful sense of humor and a quirky smile. He was a loving father 
										to his daughter Korinna and spoke of her proudly. She shared her Dad's smile. 
										For those who didn't know him well, he could appear gruff on the outside, but 
										on the inside, he was a kind, caring and compassionate individual. He was a 
										very skilled EMT and worked well in extreme situations. He had a passion for 
										photography and spoke frequently of his intentions to enroll in photography 
										school in the future. He was a published photographer who was in his glory when 
										taking fire pictures either locally or on one of his many trips to NYC. It was 
										a beautiful Fall day when Jason was laid to rest with full EMS honors. While 
										riding to Jason's interment in Deputy Bosse's Command Vehicle, the fire tones 
										rang over the radio signaling an &quot;All Out&quot; somewhere in the city of 
										Boston. It was an appropriate ending. Jason would have smiled.</p>
